# Speech Recognition Through Lip Motion Analysis

This study investigates the progress in visual speech recognition (VSR), a domain that interprets spoken language from lip movements. The research delves into the architectural components of VSR technology, specifically focusing on convolu-tional and recurrent neural network architectures. Rigorous testing has been con-ducted on the GRID corpus to ensure unbiased results. Proposed advancements aim to improve accuracy and broaden applicability through the integration of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, multi-modal audio-visual learning, and atten-tion mechanisms. The research proposes a novel deep learning model that can convert video sequences of lip movements into spoken text. This model leverages sequence-to-sequence learning with encoder-decoder components to map visual features to textual representations. Potential applications encompass speech recog-nition, accessibility solutions, and audio-visual synchronization, with a particular emphasis on diverse speaker populations and languages. The research sheds light on the evolution of VSR, highlighting the importance of multi-modal strategies, us-er-centric design principles, and robust evaluation metrics for fostering more inclu-sive and effective communication systems.
